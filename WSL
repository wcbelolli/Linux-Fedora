1. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
WSL is a compatibility layer that allows you to run a real Linux environment—including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications—directly on Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or dual boot.

How to Use Linux Commands with WSL:
Install WSL and a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu):

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

powershell
wsl --install
Restart your computer if prompted.

After restart, open the installed Linux distribution from the Start menu (e.g., Ubuntu).

Run Linux commands from Windows terminal:

You can open your Linux terminal (e.g., Ubuntu) and use any Linux command:

bash
ls -la
pwd
grep "text" filename
Or, from Command Prompt or PowerShell, you can run a Linux command directly using:

powershell
wsl ls -la
wsl grep "pattern" file.txt
This runs the command in your default WSL Linux environment.

Mixing Windows and Linux Commands:
You can run Windows programs from within WSL (e.g., notepad.exe) and Linux commands from Windows using wsl <command>.

Example: List files in Windows from Linux:

bash
cmd.exe /C dir
2. Alternative: Git Bash
Git Bash is another tool that provides a Bash emulation environment on Windows, allowing you to run many common Linux commands (but not all).

Download and install Git for Windows to use Git Bash.

3. Other Options
Cygwin: A large collection of GNU and Open Source tools that provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

Third-party tools: Tools like MobaXterm or MSYS2 also provide Linux command-line environments.
