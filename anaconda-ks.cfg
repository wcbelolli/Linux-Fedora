The anaconda-ks.cfg file is a Kickstart configuration file automatically generated by the Anaconda installer when you install a Red Hat-based Linux distribution (such as Fedora, CentOS, or Oracle Linux). This file is typically found in the /root directory after installation (i.e., /root/anaconda-ks.cfg).

What does it contain?
It records all the installation choices you made during the setup process, such as partitioning, package selection, network configuration, and user accounts.

The file is in plain text and can be viewed or edited with any text editor.

What is it used for?
Automation: You can use this file as a template for future installations. By providing it to the installer, you can automate the installation process (known as a "Kickstart" installation), making it non-interactive and repeatable.

Cloning setups: If you want to set up multiple systems with the same configuration, you can use the anaconda-ks.cfg from one system as the Kickstart file for others (with any necessary modifications).

Security Note
The file may contain sensitive information (such as root password hashes), so handle it carefully and consider removing it if you do not need it for future automated installations.

In summary:
anaconda-ks.cfg is a record of your installation choices, created by the Anaconda installer, and is primarily used for automating and replicating Linux installations on Red Hat-based systems
